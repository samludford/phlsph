# Concept

A speculative art project critiquing the commodification of basic features of social existence, and marketing strategies which present these as exciting new inventions by modern start-ups.

Mark Fisher makes the point that capitalism simultaneously erodes and depends on the family. In a culture defined by precarity, the family occupies a contradictory position: both a necessary place of respite from the strain of instability, and a burdensome cluster of attachments restricting one's ability to embody the primary virtues of precarious existence: flexibility and adaptability. (The same could be said of community in general.) Would it be possible to market a replacement to family which offered its solaces with none of its attachments?
